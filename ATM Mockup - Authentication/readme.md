- This project was done by me part of reskillamericans.us "Python track".
- What I have implemented and improved part of current solution is as below :
  -  Original solution by the instructor is [here](https://github.com/dharati-code/pythonclass/blob/main/auth.py)
  -  Implemented [withdrawal and deposit functionality](https://github.com/dharati-code/pythonclass/blob/main/auth.py#L111-L125) as here(https://github.com/dharati-code/python_programming/blob/main/ATM%20Mockup%20-%20Authentication/auth.py#L185-L223).
  -  instead of using files, I learned and implemented to use database (`sqlite3`) which comes with native python installation. 
      -  Created `user_info` table in the database. 
      -  Used `insert` for new registration
      -  Used `SELECT and update` for providing info on current and or updated balance (after withdrwal or deposit).
      -  created few functions to SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE sqlite3 database.

- Below are some improvements that can be done with the current solution:
  -  Check the length of account number - it should be 10 digit when input and provide better error handling.
  -  Provide better error handling
